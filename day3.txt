Distributed Architecture

- Multiple codebases
- Multiple deployment units
- Multiple databases

 all the components (frontend, backend, database) are loosely coupled and can be deployed independently.

 Advantages:
- Scalability: Each component can be scaled independently (vertical and horizontal scaling).
- Single point of failure: If one component fails, the others can continue to function.
- Upgrade: Upgrading one component does not require redeploying the entire system.

 Disadvantages:
- Complexity: More complex to develop, test, and deploy.
- latency: Network latency between components can affect performance.
- security: More complex to manage security as components are distributed.
- Cost: More expensive to maintain and operate due to multiple components.
- management: More difficult to manage and monitor multiple components(load balancers, databases, etc.).

replication: Replication is the process of copying data from one database to another to ensure data availability and reliability to reduce the risk of data loss.
