Latency(Ping) : Time taken to send a packet of data from one point to another and back again.
Time required to send request and receive response


Latency=Network delay+Computation delay

Network delay : Time taken to send a packet of data from one point to another and back again.
Computation delay : Time taken to process the request and generate a response. Same for monolithic and microservices.

latency: Monolithic < Distributed 


Reducing Latency Methods:
Cashing :Store information in memory for specific time period for faster access
CDN : Content Delivery Network, a system of distributed servers that deliver web content to a user based on the user's geographic location.
