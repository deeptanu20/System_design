 
 Monolithic Architecture: 
- Single codebase
- Single deployment unit
- Single database


All the components (frontend, backend, database) are tightly coupled and deployed as a single unit.

Advantages:
- Simplicity: Easy to develop, test, and deploy.
- Performance: No network latency between components.
- security: Easier to manage security as everything is in one place.

Disadvantages:
- Scalability: Difficult to scale individual components.
- Single point of failure: If one component fails, the entire system can go down.
- Upgrade: Upgrading one component requires redeploying the entire system.
